### Undergrad Thesis

> Phase 1) Skin cancer classification : Improving performance using Transfer Learning
> Phase 2) Add more data using careful augmentation (thought of many variations including using GANs [Alas I don't own a GPU])
> Phase 3) Do more generalized model, take inspiration from YOLO
> Phase 4) Paper, maybe :/
